# Scrape Twitter Data of Members of the European Parliament

In this tutorial I'm showing how to scrape all the Tweets of MEPs by first scraping the Twitter accounts from the website of the European Parliament. After harvesting the data with rvest, we are scraping the data using rtweet. With help of the tidyverse collection, we are able to clean and work with the data provided by the EP.
